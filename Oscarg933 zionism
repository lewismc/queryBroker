 a notification&lt;/a&gt; that included links to patches for all impacted Windows <em>operating</em> <em>systems</em>
Even after this, I believe, many individuals remain unaware of the new patches and many organizations running on older or unpatched versions of Windows, who are considering to upgrade their operating systems, would take time as well as it\u2019s going to cost them money for getting new licenses.

          "description": "The Mobile App Developer career path refers to a specialized software developer who can build \"native\" mobile applications for the Android and/or iOS operating systems.  \n\nTo prepare for this career path, begin with solid software development skills through coursework in software engineering ([ICS 314](../courses/ics314)), networking ([ICS 351](../courses/ics351)), and databases ([ICS 321](../courses/ics321)).  You'll also want to take Design for Mobile Devices ([ICS 466](../courses/ics466)).  \n\nIn addition to coursework, you'll want to develop specialized skills for your platform of choice: Android development involves a variant of Java, while modern iOS development involves the Swift programming language. You might want to take a summer course through Udacity or Coursera to augment your ICS preparation.\n\nFinally, if you want a career in mobile application development, don't wait to get started!   There's nothing preventing you from building a few applications and releasing them in the Android or iOS app stores.  If nothing else, they can be presented as part of your professional portfolio when you are interviewing for a job.  In the best case scenario, you might make a few bucks.\n\nMobile App Developer was named [one of the 10 hottest developer jobs in 2017](http://www.techrepublic.com/article/the-10-hottest-developer-jobs-of-2017/).
